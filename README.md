# EstimatingArbitrationAmount_ProfAgarwalIIMA
This project is about classifying arbitration disputes given their details and estimating a settlement amount using RAG models and AI
To classify cases of arbitration and legal disputes, and estimate a settlement amount by gathering relevant information on a case using 
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models and Artificial Intelligence.
Approach
• Gathered information about legal disputes using Web Crawling and Scraping of top relevant websites.
• Identified key features and used Label-Studio to classify data into defined labels for easier model training.
• Implemented the Agentic RAG model and enhanced it using the Deepseek API to predict settlement amounts.
Results • Decent classification of cases with improvements for numerical assessment of settlement amount required.
